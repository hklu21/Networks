 * This project is based on the Simple Router assignment included in the

 *
 * While most of the code for chirouter has been written from scratch, some
 * of the original Stanford code is still present in some places and, whenever

 * chirouter_process_ethernet_frame - Process a single inbound Ethernet frame
 *
 * This function will get called every time an Ethernet frame is received by
 * a router. This function receives the router context for the router that
 * received the frame, and the inbound frame (the ethernet_frame_t struct
 * contains a pointer to the interface where the frame was received).
 * Take into account that the chirouter code will free the frame after this
 * function returns so, if you need to persist a frame (e.g., because you're
 * adding it to a list of withheld frames in the pending ARP request list)
 * you must make a deep copy of the frame.
 *
 * chirouter can manage multiple routers at once, but does so in a single
 * thread. i.e., it is guaranteed that this function is always called
 * sequentially, and that there will not be concurrent calls to this
 * function. If two routers receive Ethernet frames "at the same time",
 * they will be ordered arbitrarily and processed sequentially, not
 * concurrently (and with each call receiving a different router context)
